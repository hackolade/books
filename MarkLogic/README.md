MarkLogic is a database designed from the ground up to make massive quantities of heterogeneous data easily accessible through search. MarkLogic is a leading 'multi-model' database, supporting traditional relational tables, XML and JSON documents, and RDF triples, all with ACID transactions capabilities.

Our role with this book is to make you aware of all of the possibilities, cover the pros and cons, and share use cases. This should inspire readers as they design their schemas. The book includes a recipe for a proven approach to data modeling. It is a toolbox in which we describe no less than 14 different schema design patterns for MarkLogic.

MarkLogic design patterns are reusable solutions for many of the commonly occurring use cases encountered when designing applications that leverage persistence in MarkLogic.

Read *MarkLogic Data Modeling and Schema Design* if you are a data architect or modeler who needs to expand your modeling skills to include MarkLogic, or if you are a database administrator or developer who knows MarkLogic but needs to expand your schema design skills.
