Neo4j is a popular graph database that has gained popularity in recent years. Its strength lies in its ability to store and query highly connected data, making it a popular choice for applications such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection. Neo4j's unique property graph model enables developers to store data as nodes and relationships, providing a rich and expressive way to model complex domains.

Read Neo4j Data Modeling if you are a data architect or modeler who needs to expand your modeling skills to include Neo4j, or if you are a database administrator or developer who knows Neo4j but needs to expand your schema design skills.

Most of the principles in this book are applicable to other NoSQL property graph databases, such as Cosmos DB with Gremlin API, Amazon Neptune with Gremlin API, JanusGraph, and TinkerPop.


## Co-Authors

David Fauth has been working with Neo4j and graph databases since about 2012.  Graphs are a natural extension of the way we think so the technology was fascinating.  Since joining Neo4j in 2014, Davis has worked with customers implementing Neo4j to address their business needs. A successful Neo4j deployment starts with a data model that will help address a business' most pressing questions.

Steve Hoberman has trained more than 10,000 people in data modeling since 1992. Steve is known for his entertaining and interactive teaching style (watch out for flying candy!), and organizations around the globe have brought Steve in to teach his Data Modeling Master Class, which is recognized as the most comprehensive data modeling course in the industry.

Steve is the author of nine books on data modeling. He is the founder of the Design Challenges group, creator of the Data Modeling Institute’s Data Modeling Certification exam, Conference Chair of the Data Modeling Zone conferences, director of Technics Publications, lecturer at Columbia University, and recipient of the Data Administration Management Association (DAMA) International Professional Achievement Award.
