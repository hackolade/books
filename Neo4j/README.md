Neo4j is a popular graph database that has gained popularity in recent years. Its strength lies in its ability to store and query highly connected data, making it a popular choice for applications such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection. Neo4j's unique property graph model enables developers to store data as nodes and relationships, providing a rich and expressive way to model complex domains.

Read Neo4j Data Modeling if you are a data architect or modeler who needs to expand your modeling skills to include Neo4j, or if you are a database administrator or developer who knows Neo4j but needs to expand your schema design skills.

Most of the principles in this book are applicable to other NoSQL property graph databases, such as Cosmos DB with Gremlin API, Amazon Neptune with Gremlin API, JanusGraph, and TinkerPop.
