MongoDB has become increasingly popular as a leading NoSQL database. Its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use have made it a popular choice for many developers and businesses. MongoDB's document-based model allows for flexible storage of complex data and easy evolution of the schema.

As it turns out, data modeling is even more important for MongoDB than for relational databases, as there are no guardrails like the rules of normalization. The consequence is that the responsibility to ensure consistency, integrity, and quality shifts elsewhere.

Learn how to properly design your data model with MongoDB to avoid problems later.

Our role with this book is to make you aware of all of the possibilities, cover the pros and cons, and share use cases. This should inspire readers as they design their schemas. The book includes a recipe for a proven approach to data modeling. It is a toolbox in which we describe no less than 16 different schema design patterns for MongoDB documents.

The book’s introduction and three chapters cover the Align, Refine, and Design approach.  By rebranding Conceptual, Logical, and Physical into Align, Refine, and Design, we include what the level does in the name. Align is about agreeing on the common business vocabulary so everyone is *aligned* on terminology and general initiative scope. Refine is about capturing the business requirements. That is, refining our knowledge of the initiative to focus on what is important. Design is about the technical requirements. That is, making sure we accommodate the unique needs of software and hardware on our model.

MongoDB design patterns are reusable solutions for many of the commonly occurring use cases encountered when designing applications that leverage persistence in MongoDB.

Read *MongoDB Data Modeling and Schema Design* if you are a data architect or modeler who needs to expand your modeling skills to include MongoDB, or if you are a database administrator or developer who knows MongoDB but needs to expand your schema design skills.

Most of the principles in this book are applicable to other NoSQL document databases, such as [Couchbase](https://hackolade.com/help/Couchbase.html), Azure [Cosmos DB](https://hackolade.com/help/CosmosDB.html), Amazon [DocumentDB](https://hackolade.com/help/DocumentDB.html), [MarkLogic](https://hackolade.com/help/MarkLogic.html).



## Co-authors

Daniel Coupal is a Staff Engineer at MongoDB. He built the Data Modeling class for MongoDB University. He also defined a methodology to develop for MongoDB and created a series of Schema Design Patterns to optimize Data Modeling for MongoDB and other NoSQL databases.

Pascal Desmarets is the founder and CEO of [Hackolade](https://hackolade.com), a data modeling tool for NoSQL databases, storage formats, REST APIs, and JSON in RDBMS. Hackolade pioneered [Polyglot Data Modeling](https://hackolade.com/polyglot-data-modeling.html), which is data modeling for polyglot data persistence and data exchanges. With Hackolade’s [Metadata-as-Code](https://hackolade.com/metadata-as-code.html) strategy, data models are co-located with application code in Git repositories as they evolve and are published to business-facing data catalogs to ensure a shared understanding of the meaning and context of your data.  Pascal is also an advocate of [Domain-Driven Data Modeling](https://hackolade.com/domain-driven-data-modeling.html).

Steve Hoberman has trained more than 10,000 people in data modeling since 1992. Steve is known for his entertaining and interactive teaching style (watch out for flying candy!), and organizations around the globe have brought Steve in to teach his Data Modeling Master Class, which is recognized as the most comprehensive data modeling course in the industry.

Steve is the author of nine books on data modeling. He is the founder of the Design Challenges group, creator of the Data Modeling Institute’s Data Modeling Certification exam, Conference Chair of the Data Modeling Zone conferences, director of Technics Publications, lecturer at Columbia University, and recipient of the Data Administration Management Association (DAMA) International Professional Achievement Award.
