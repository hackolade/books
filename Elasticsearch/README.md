Elasticsearch, although primarily known as a search and analytics engine, can also be considered as a NoSQL database. It is designed to store and retrieve large volumes of structured and unstructured data in a distributed and scalable manner. Elasticsearch stores data in a schema-less JSON format, allowing for flexible and dynamic data modeling. It provides powerful indexing and querying capabilities, allowing you to search and retrieve data based on various criteria and perform aggregations for analytics purposes. With its distributed architecture and built-in replication, Elasticsearch ensures high availability and fault tolerance. It's a popular choice for applications that require fast and efficient data retrieval, real-time analytics, and horizontal scalability.

Read *Elasticsearch Data Modeling and Schema Design* if you are a data architect or modeler who needs to expand your modeling skills to include Elasticsearch, or if you are a database administrator or developer who knows Elasticsearch but needs to expand your schema design skills.



## Co-authors

Rafid entered the Data Modeling space at the young age of 22, after completing his undergraduate degree in Biology and Mathematics from the University of Ottawa. In July 2020, he became the 10th person worldwide and first Canadian to enter the Data Modeling Institute's DMC Hall of Fame. He has experience creating and expanding standardized financial data models and data delivery mechanisms using various modeling techniques. He also has experience in the data analytics space, performing in-depth analysis of Capital Markets, Retail Banking, and Insurance data. He has worked on both relational and NoSQL data models. 

Rafid was a speaker at the 2021 Data Modeling Zone Europe conference, where he spoke about reverse engineering physical NoSQL data models to logical data models. In his spare time, Rafid enjoys recording music and creating digital art. Having a creative mind, he enjoys the design process and innovation associated with data modeling.

Steve Hoberman has trained more than 10,000 people in data modeling since 1992. Steve is known for his entertaining and interactive teaching style (watch out for flying candy!), and organizations around the globe have brought Steve in to teach his Data Modeling Master Class, which is recognized as the most comprehensive data modeling course in the industry.

Steve is the author of nine books on data modeling. He is the founder of the Design Challenges group, creator of the Data Modeling Instituteâ€™s Data Modeling Certification exam, Conference Chair of the Data Modeling Zone conferences, director of Technics Publications, lecturer at Columbia University, and recipient of the Data Administration Management Association (DAMA) International Professional Achievement Award.
