**Each book in the Align > Refine > Design series covers conceptual, logical, and physical data modeling (schema design) for a specific database product, combining the best of data modeling practices with solution-specific considerations, which lead to effective communication tools and extensible datastore foundations.**

The book’s introduction and three chapters cover the proven approach. The introduction covers the three modeling characteristics of precise, minimal, and visual; the three model components of entities, relationships, and attributes; the three model levels of conceptual (align), logical (refine), and physical (design); the three modeling perspectives of relational, dimensional, and NoSQL; and the three modeling challenges with NoSQL (tactical, strategy, and cultural). Next, Chapter 1 covers Align, Chapter 2 Refine, and Chapter 3 Design. An animal shelter case study creates continuity across these three modeling levels.

If you are interested in learning how to build multiple database solutions, read all the books in the Align > Refine > Design series. Since each book is created from the same template, once you read one, you’ll be able to pick up the techniques for another database solution quickly.

Using the terms Align, Refine, and Design instead of Conceptual, Logical, and Physical has two benefits: greater purpose and broader context. 

Greater purpose means that by rebranding into Align, Refine, and Design, we include what the level does in the name.   Broader context means there is more than just the models. We distinguish the model from its broader phase. If you are working with a group of stakeholders who may not warm up to the traditional names of conceptual, logical, and physical, you can call the conceptual the *alignment model*, the logical the *refinement model*, and the physical the *design model*. Use the terms that would have the largest positive impact on your audience.
