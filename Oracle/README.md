JSON-Relational Duality is a revolutionary new concept that combines aspects of relational databases and document databases in one combined data model. The functionality was recently released with Oracle Database 23ai. With Oracle Duality Views, it is possible to maintain data integrity thanks to the relational model while providing developers with JSON objects to manipulate easily in application code.

This means that applications can access (create, query, modify) the same data as a set of JSON documents or as a set of related tables and columns, and both approaches can be employed at the same time.

In this book you will learn how to:

- Not be forced into making compromises between normalization and NoSQL
- Eliminate data duplication and the risk of inconsistencies when working with JSON documents
- Design the optimal schema for duality views and avoid object-relational impedance mismatch for your developers

Read *Oracle Database 23ai Data Modeling and Schema Design for JSON-Relational Duality* if you are a data architect or modeler who needs to expand your modeling skills to include Oracle 23ai Duality, or if you are a database administrator or developer who knows Oracle but needs to expand your schema design skills

Hackolade pioneered [Polyglot Data Modeling](https://hackolade.com/polyglot-data-modeling.html), which is data modeling for polyglot data persistence and data exchanges. With Hackolade’s [Metadata-as-Code](https://hackolade.com/metadata-as-code.html) strategy, data models are co-located with application code in Git repositories as they evolve and are published to business-facing data catalogs to ensure a shared understanding of the meaning and context of your data.  Pascal is also an advocate of [Domain-Driven Data Modeling](https://hackolade.com/domain-driven-data-modeling.html).
